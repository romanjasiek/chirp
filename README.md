#Chirp

This is a pretty simple Twitter clone, made with Next.js, NextAuth, Firebase and TailwindCSS. Needs a lot of improvements and a lot of functionalities to be implemented. I made this for practice purposes, to get a better understanding of the used technologies in here. Maybe someday I will add the missing things to this project.
